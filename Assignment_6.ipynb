    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world, \n",
    "and only exposing the necessary information through methods and interfaces. This helps to prevent outside interference\n",

    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential features and ignoring the rest.\n",
    "This allows for the creation of more generalized and reusable classes, as well as easier maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability for a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all of its attributes \n",
    "and methods. This allows for the creation of more specialized classes that can reuse and build upon the behavior of their parent \n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different\n",
    "ways. This allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in the design of the code."
